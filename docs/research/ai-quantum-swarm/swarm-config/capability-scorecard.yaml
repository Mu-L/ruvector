# Capability Scorecard for AI-Quantum Research Swarm
# Machine-runnable scoring rubric for consistent agent evaluation
version: 1
max_points: 100

criteria:
  novelty:
    points: 15
    anchors:
      high: "New mechanism or theorem level idea, not a remix. Clear delta vs prior art."
      mid: "Known ideas combined in a new way, moderate delta."
      low: "Mostly standard with minor changes."
    scoring:
      high: [13, 15]
      mid: [7, 12]
      low: [1, 6]

  synergy:
    points: 20
    anchors:
      high: "Quantum and AI create value that neither side can plausibly do alone."
      mid: "Some benefit, but could be matched classically with effort."
      low: "Two parallel parts without emergent gain."
    scoring:
      high: [17, 20]
      mid: [10, 16]
      low: [1, 9]

  feasibility:
    points: 20
    anchors:
      high: "Prototype in 6 weeks, credible path to usable in 12 to 18 months."
      mid: "Prototype in 12 weeks, usable in 18 to 24 months."
      low: "Blocked by hardware, data, or theory."
    scoring:
      high: [17, 20]
      mid: [10, 16]
      low: [1, 9]

  ruvector_integration:
    points: 15
    anchors:
      high: "Direct reuse of existing crates and abstractions. Minimal new primitives."
      mid: "Some reuse, but requires new core types."
      low: "Mostly standalone."
    scoring:
      high: [13, 15]
      mid: [7, 12]
      low: [1, 6]

  real_world_impact:
    points: 15
    anchors:
      high: "Clear buyer, clear workflow, clear measurable win."
      mid: "Plausible value, but unclear adoption path."
      low: "Interesting but speculative."
    scoring:
      high: [13, 15]
      mid: [7, 12]
      low: [1, 6]

  verification_path:
    points: 15
    anchors:
      high: "Falsifiable, benchmarkable, independent external signals exist."
      mid: "Benchmarks exist but weak falsifiability or single source."
      low: "Hard to test, mostly narrative."
    scoring:
      high: [13, 15]
      mid: [7, 12]
      low: [1, 6]

# Scoring rules for agents
agent_rules:
  - "Each score must cite specific evidence"
  - "Use anchor descriptions to calibrate scores"
  - "If uncertain, default to mid-range"
  - "Multiple agents should converge within 2 points per criterion"
  - "Re-score quarterly with updated evidence"
